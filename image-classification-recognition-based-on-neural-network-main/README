I'm learning the basic knowledge of PyTorch recently. I write this practice as the result of the first stage.

The dataset I use is CIFAR10, which contains 10 categories:
0. airplane
1. automobile
2. bird
3. cat
4. deer
5. dog
6. frog
7. horse
8. ship
9. truck

I build a neural network model aiming to successfully recognize which of the category that a picture should belong to.
